## Variation Of FFT and IT's Application
###### We have worked on mainly three algorithms Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Number Theoritic Transform(NTT) and Fast Walsh-Hadamard(FWHT)
###### The Runtime time of these algorithms is O(nLog(n))
###### For Run:
###### these are the cpp file so compile with g++ filename.cpp and run ./a.out
